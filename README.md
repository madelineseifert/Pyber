# Pyber
In this project, I analyzed generated data on a fictional ride sharing company called Pyber. I analyzed the data given to me to determine was a correlation between the type of city and the average fare. In addition to my analysis, I also created visualizations based on the data. These were the key insights that I found:

The greatest percentage of rides reported is in Urban areas (68.4%).

There are more drivers in areas where there are more rides.

The greatest percentage of fares are made in areas where there are more drivers.

This project was done completely in my Jupyter Notebook. To do my analysis, I used the Pandas and Numpy Python libraries. I used the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to create my visualizations.
